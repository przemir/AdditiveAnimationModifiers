Panel in: Properties -> Data -> Additive animation modifiers.

Option "Enable addon for scene" is necessary to calculate additive animation. Hovewer, addon forces all bones (even those unused in action) to be calculated every frame.

Installation

It is a plugin. Select "File -> User Preferences" and choose "Addon" tab. Click "Install from file..." and choose downloaded file.

Setting a shortcut

There is insert keyframe menu similar to this activated using 'I' key.

User preferences -> Input -> 3D View -> 3D View (Global).
Press "Add new".
Fill field with "anim.insert_keyframe_menu".

Limitation

- Only location and rotation
- Auto generating keyframes should be disabled
- Every time scene frame changed, all bones (even those unused in action) will be calculated from rest pose. To disable this behaviour disable "Enable addon for scene".
